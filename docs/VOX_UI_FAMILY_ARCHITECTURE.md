# VOX UI Family Architecture

**Status:** CANON

## Goal

All Ultima Vox audio products share one visual and interaction language while preserving product-specific workflows.

The shared layer is **VOX UI**. Individual plugins compose it rather than reimplementing their own themes.

## Product family

Initial consumers:

- Vox Electronic / Trance Engine;
- Vox Drums Engine;
- Mastering Engine;
- future Ultima Vox VST3/Standalone products.

## Shared layer

The following are family-level and must remain common unless the design-system version changes:

- colors and semantic color roles;
- spacing grid and radii;
- typography scale;
- component states;
- `VoxLookAndFeel`;
- standard rotary controls;
- standard buttons, toggles and combo boxes;
- panels and section headers;
- graph visual language;
- meters visual language;
- keyboard-focus/hover/disabled behavior;
- scaling rules;
- tooltip and fine-adjustment conventions;
- realtime-safety boundary between UI and DSP.

Canonical details are defined in [`UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

## Product-specific layer

Product identity is created by workflow, content hierarchy and specialized widgets, not by replacing the shared theme.

### Electronic / Trance Engine

Product widgets may include:

- instrument rack;
- piano roll;
- step sequencer;
- modulation matrix;
- sound/pattern/routing/zones/macros pages.

### Vox Drums Engine

Product widgets may include:

- drum pads;
- sample waveform/editor;
- velocity editor;
- choke groups;
- per-pad routing;
- drum sequencer.

### Mastering Engine

Product widgets may include:

- spectrum analyzer;
- loudness meter;
- true-peak meter;
- gain-reduction meter;
- stereo/correlation visualization;
- module chain;
- A/B and reference controls.

Mastering UI may be visually calmer and less accent-heavy, but still uses the same tokens and component grammar.

## Source layout

Current bootstrap location in this repository:

```text
libs/vox-ui/
  CMakeLists.txt
  Tokens.h
  Typography.h
  VoxLookAndFeel.h/.cpp
  VoxComponents.h/.cpp
```

The module deliberately uses namespace:

```cpp
vox::ui
```

and must not depend on product DSP code.

## Long-term distribution

When a second plugin actively consumes the shared layer, move `libs/vox-ui` to a dedicated shared repository/library rather than maintaining copies.

Recommended target repository name:

```text
ultima-vox/vox-ui
```

Consumers should pin a known version/tag or commit. Do not track an unpinned moving branch in release builds.

Suggested versioning:

```text
v1.x  backward-compatible additions and visual refinements
v2.x  breaking component/API or design-language changes
```

## Dependency direction

Allowed:

```text
Product UI -> vox-ui -> JUCE GUI
```

Not allowed:

```text
vox-ui -> product DSP
vox-ui -> PluginProcessor
vox-ui -> presets/rack/instrument engines
DSP realtime path -> vox-ui
```

## Migration rule

Existing product UI does not need a big-bang rewrite.

Migrate in this order:

1. tokens;
2. LookAndFeel;
3. knob/button/combo primitives;
4. panels/headers;
5. graphs/meters;
6. product pages;
7. remove legacy local styling only after parity is confirmed.

Every migration step must preserve plugin state, automation IDs and DSP behavior.

## Acceptance criteria for a VOX-family plugin

A plugin belongs to the common UI family when:

- shared visual primitives come from VOX UI;
- no private duplicate palette exists;
- common controls have the same interaction semantics;
- resize/scaling works at the family-supported scale factors;
- specialized widgets visually derive from shared tokens;
- UI changes do not alter realtime DSP safety;
- product-specific deviations are documented rather than silently forked.
